# Changelog

## 1.0.0 — 2026-10-01

The first release: Ninaivu's screens over a small, steady engine.

- **Gallery** (`/`) — Ninaivu's family app: timeline with date scrubber, folders, favourites,
  albums, search by name/folder/date/camera, full-screen viewer, video playback, download
  (one file or a zip), Tamil and English.
- **Sign-in like Ninaivu** — profile picker; no secret, PIN or password per person;
  *Just looking* for public photos (can be turned off); admins sign in on the console.
- **Admin console** (`/admin`) — first-day guide, overview with a "what each role sees"
  preview, library folders and rescans, people (role, entry, assigned folder, sign out
  everywhere), folder visibility rules with undo, settings, backup download.
- **Roles and visibility** — Admin / Family / Guest; Public / Family / Hidden, by folder rule
  or per photo; checked on the server for every item, page and link.
- **Share links** — one photo or an album, optional password and expiry; visitors and guests
  get copies without location or camera data.
- **Engine** — Flask + waitress, SQLite (WAL with fallback), incremental scanner (size + time),
  WebP previews in two sizes, dates from EXIF, video headers or file names, folder watching,
  daily index backups (last seven kept).
- **Launch** — `start.cmd` / `start.sh` make their own environment; start with Windows or
  systemd; one instance per data folder; port 8080 or the next free one.
- **Move up** — `--export` writes a file the full Ninaivu can import ([docs/UPGRADE.md](docs/UPGRADE.md)).
- **Recovery** — `--reset-password USERNAME` for a forgotten password.

Not in Lite (stays in Ninaivu): AI of any kind, cloud and phone backup, editing and rotation,
deleting media, maps, the screen lock, HTTPS.
