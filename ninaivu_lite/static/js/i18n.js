 * than showing `gallery.empty.title` to somebody's mother — an untranslated
 * sentence is a small failure, a key is a broken page.
 *
 * **Nothing is translated by guessing.** Only strings that appear in a
 * locale file are replaced. Photograph names, folder names, people's names
 * and anything else that came out of the library are left exactly as they
 * are, because they are not this application's words to change.

 * which puts the verb last and the folder first, came out as English word
 * order in Tamil words. So such a sentence is marked once, on the element
 * that holds it:
 *
 *   data-i18n-rich="It moves into the &lt;strong&gt;_deleted&lt;/strong&gt; folder…"
 *
 * The key is the element's English, whitespace collapsed, with its markup
 * written as bare tags — `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<b>`, `<i>`, `<code>`, `<kbd>`,
 * `<span>`, and `<a>` with no href — and `&lt;`/`&gt;` for a `<` or `>` that is
 * text. The translation carries the same tags wherever its own grammar wants
 * them.
 *
 * **Markup in a translation is never markup.** It is read by `parseRich()`,
 * which knows those tags and nothing else: no attributes, no entities beyond
 * the two, no innerHTML. Anything else in it and the translation is not used.
 *
 * **The page's elements are the page's.** The first time a sentence is met,
 * while it is still the template's English, the elements in it are noted by
 * tag in the order they come. A translation's first `<a>` is then that first
 * link — the same element, moved, so its href, its id, its class and anything
 * a script attached to it stay exactly as they were. A translation with a
 * different number of any tag than the English has cannot be matched up, and
 * the English is shown instead.
 *
 * **An empty tag keeps what is in it.** `<code></code>` in a key is a slot the
 * words do not reach — an icon, a `{{image}}` placeholder, a name the page
 * fills in — and an element whose words a script has since replaced is left
 * with them, by the same rule `put()` keeps for everything else.

 * English is the key read the same way, so switching back puts the English
 * sentence together from the same elements.
